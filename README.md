# AlgoTrading

Objective: 

Develop a model that predicts the buying and selling of the S&P 500
Use LSTM learning algorithm to discover the patterns of the stock

Challenges:

Limited amount of time(data as well as actual time)
Determining effective amount of nodes/ adjusting hyperparameters
Deciding type of technical indicators and activation function

Constraints:

It is not real world
Due to pattern changes, the model can only predict so far into the future

IMPLEMENTATION:

Neural Network:

We wanted to use neural networks for this project, and the best type of neural network to predict the stock market is a LSTM, which is a branch of a RNN

LSTM:

This neural network is especially helpful for time series data because it able to remember or forget certain dater through each information
This is helpful because the stock market is very unpredictable, so being able to forget irrelevant things is super beneficial
Also used a logistics model for classification

RESULTS:

Classification:

Where we currently are right now, we are able to provide an accuracy of anywhere from 48-58%, which shows us that a little more than half the time we are predicting it correctly
Made a logistic model and a LSTM model

Regression Model:

Our logistic model is a little more promising because they are able to give a better visualization for what is happening
